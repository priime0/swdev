## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 4

Indicate below each bullet which method takes care of each task:

1 'rendering the referee state' 

2. 'scoring a placement' 

3. The 'scoring a placement' functionality clearly performs four different checks: 
  - 'length of placement'
  - 'bonus for finishing'
  - 'segments extended along the line (row, column) of placements'
  - 'segments extended orthogonal to the line (row, column) of placements'
  - indicate which of these are factored out into separate
    methods/functions and where.
   
The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub perma-link to
the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
