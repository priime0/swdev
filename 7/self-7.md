## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 7

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

The require revision calls for turning Q bonus points and
finished-the-game bonus points into named constants

1. Which unit tests check the Q-bonus functionality? Is it abstracted
   over the named constant? 

2. Which unit tests check the finished-the-game functionality? Is it
   abstracted over the named constant?

3. Do you also have integration tests that show how setting the bonus
   constants to different constants yields different results for the
   same starting point? (This is optional but helps with milestone 8
   and fits to the request.) 


The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
