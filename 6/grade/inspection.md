# Self-Eval [20/20]

Thank you for a helpful self-eval.

# Programming [104.5/160]

[-12.5] `name`, `setup`, `take-turn`, `new-tiles`, and `win` functions in Player do not have a purpose statement.

[-4] Did not include functionality for setting up the players with the initial information, but gets partial credit for honesty in self-eval.

[-4] Did not include functionality for informing surviving winners and losers, but gets partial credit for honesty in self-eval.

[-30] Missing distinct unit tests for referee functionality as a whole.

[-5] Missing explicit explanation for how the Referee discovers ill-behaved behavior (e.g. referencing which functions the Referee calls that checks for misbehaving players)

# Design [20/30]

[-10] The design does not mention how a person can interact with the observerâ€™s view. One way of doing this is to have clickable arrows so that an user can go through visualized game states.
