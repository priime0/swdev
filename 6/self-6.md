## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 6

Indicate below each bullet which piece of your code takes care of each task:

1. the five pieces of player functionality

2. `setting up players` functionality in the referee component 

3. `running a game` functionality in the referee component

4. `managing a round` functionality in the referee component
    (This must be factored out to discover the end-of-game condition.)

5. `managing an individual turn` functionality in the referee component

6. `informing survivors of the outcome` functionality in the referee component

7. unit tests for the `referee`:

   - five distinct unit tests for the overall `referee` functionality
   - unit tests for the abvove pieces of functionality 
   
8. the explanation of what is considered ill-behaved player and how the referee deals with it.

The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub perma-link to
the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
