## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. does your implementation come with a separate data representationn for tiles?
   
2. does your implementation come with a separate data representation for map coordinates?
   - does it include an interpretation statement?
   
3. does your functionality for creating and extending maps come with
   signatures and purpose statements?

4. does your functionality for "determining all those places where a
   specific tile can be inserted so that it fits according to the
   matching rules of The Q Game" come with a signature and purpose
   statement? does it factor out the following, separate pieces of
   functionality?

    - finding all feasible places meaning free neighbor tiles

    - determining all (four) neighbors of a spot 

    - checking the basic "fits" rule from the Q description

#### Notes 

Remember that if you think the name of a method/function is _totally
obvious_, there is no need for a purpose statement.

The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub perma-link to
the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
