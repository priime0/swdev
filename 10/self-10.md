## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 10

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task.

The data representation of configurations clearly needs the following
pieces of functionality. Explain how your chosen data representation 

- implements creation within programs _and_ from JSON specs 

- enforces that each configuration specifies a fixed set of properties (no more, no less)

- supports the retrieval of properties 

- sets properties (what happens when the property shouldn't exist?) 

- unit tests for these pieces of functionality

Explain how the server, referee, and scoring functionalities are abstracted
over their respective configurations.

Does the server touch the referee or scoring configuration, other than
passing it on?

Does the referee touch the scoring configuration, other than passing
it on?

The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
