## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 8

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

- concerning the modifications to the referee: 

  - is the referee programmed to the observer's interface
    or is it hardwired?

  - if an observer is desired, is every state per player turn sent to
    the observer? Where? 

  - if an observer is not desired, how does the referee avoid calls to
    the observer?

- concerning the implementation of the observer:

  - does the purpose statement explain how to program to the
    observer's interface? 

  - does the purpose statement explain how a user would use the
    observer's view? Or is it explained elsewhere? 

The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
