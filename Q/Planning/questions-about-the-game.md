**SUBJECT:** Questions Concerning the Game

1. Is a tile adjacent to a row and column sequence constrained by both?

2. When extending an existing sequence, as per bullet #2 in `Scoring a
   Turn`, are points assigned based on the length of the existing
   sequence, the added sequence, or the union of both sequences?

3. When placing a tile that interacts with a row sequence and a column
   sequence, like in Question 1, do both the adjacent row and column
   sequences assign points, or is it only one of the two? If so, how is
   that determined (arbitrarily, or user choice)?
