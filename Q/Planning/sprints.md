Rough split:

Sprint 1:

- Basic data representations (tiles, map, etc)
- Player-referee interface

Sprint 2:

- Referee implementation

Sprint 3:

- Player implementation

Second sprint (referee) relates to Sprint 1 because it relies on the
defined interface between players and referees.

Third sprint (player) relates to Sprint 2 because it relies on both
prior components, and allows us to test the referee implementation and
game logic.
