## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 3

Indicate below each bullet which method takes care of each task:

1. 'referee state to public knowledge'

2. 'completing a turn action' 
   
3. 'checking legality of proposed sequence of placements'
   plus its unit tests

4. The 'checking legality of proposed sequence of placements'
   functionality clearly performs three different checks: 
   - 'that the player owns the tiles it wishes to place'
   - 'that all placements are either in the same row xor the same column'
   - 'that all placed tiles fit into the board', sequentially 
   - Indicate how these checks are factored out into separate methods/functions.
   
The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
