## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 5

Indicate below each bullet which piece of your code takes care of each task:

1. a data definition (inc. interpretation) for the result of a strategy

2. the `dag` strategy 

3. the `ldasg` strategy 

4. a data definition (inc. interpretation) for the result of a strategy iterator

5. unit tests for the `dag` strategy
   - one for a 'pass' decision
   - one for a 'replace all tiles' decision
   - one for a 'place this tile there' decision

6. unit tests for the `ldaag` strategy
   - one for a 'pass' decision
   - one for a 'replace all tiles' decision
   - one for a 'place this tile there' decision

7. unit tests for the strategy iteration functionality 
   - one for a 'pass' decision
   - one for a 'replace all tiles' decision
   - one for a _sequence of_ 'place this tile there' decision

8. how does your design abstract the common strategy iteration functionality 

9. does your design abstract the common search through the sorted tiles?
   (for a bonus)
   
The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub perma-link to
the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
